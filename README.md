# doc-parser
Extract information from Office Open XML files

## Overview
Basic functionality involves extending one of the Parser classes in doc_parser.py. The ParserCollection class in that module also simplifies the parsing of multiple documents and outputting data as csv files.

See example_script.py for an example of an extended Parser class and ParserCollection in action.
